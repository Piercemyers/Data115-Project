# Data115-Project

### Motivation
For my personal data set project I was interested in doing something with sneakers involved as I am into reselling and love sneakers. I decided I wanted to look at sneakers and see how time post release of sneakers and shoe size affected sales of certain sneakers. More specfically I looked at 3 yeezy V2 colorways, some were released at the end of 2016 and the other one was at the beginning of 2017. One of which rereleased this month of December 2020.

### Data Sources
For my data source I went to StockX which is an online marketplace for buying and selling sneakers and was able to find data of Yeezy and Off-White nike shoes from 9/1/2017 to 2/13/19 that they published for free. The data was orginal used from StockX for a data analytics competetion they had for people to perform analysis on the data on whatever they wanted. The data set had a totla of 99,956 total sales including 27,794 Off-White sales and 72,162 Yeezy sales. These sales were also only for the United States.
 
 ### Data Process
 To process the data I didn't have to do much. I converted the Sale Price and the Retail Price to remove the dollar sign so I could work with numbers in my jupyter notebook. Other than that I just broke up the data in my analysis by column to work with indiviual columns of data such as 'Sale Price', and created new data frames for each yeezy. Also, I had to covert date times so I could that they were friendly to work with on jupyter notebook I did this via pd.to_datetime(df['column of data']).
