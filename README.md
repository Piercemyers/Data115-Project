# Data115-Project

### Motivation
For my personal data set project I was intersed in doing something with sneakers involved. I decided I wanted to look at sneakers and see how time post release of sneakers and shoe size affected sales of certain sneakers. More specfically I looked at 3 yeezys, some were released at the end of 2016 and the other one was at the beginning of 2017.
